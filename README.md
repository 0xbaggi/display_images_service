# üöÄ Display Images Service

üìö About
-----------------

The Display Images Service is a Node.js service designed to display images on the Liquid Galaxy screens. It is used in the LG Space Visualizations app to show rover images from the Mars 2020 Mission on the Liquid Galaxy using Chromium pages.

üìù Before Running
-----------------

1.  Ensure the Liquid Galaxy core is installed. More information about the installation can be found in this [repository](https://github.com/LiquidGalaxyLAB/liquid-galaxy).

2.  Ensure **Node.js version 16** is installed on the master machine by running:


```bash
node -v
```

1.  The output should look like v16.20.2. If not, install the correct version by running:


```bash
curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup\_16.x | sudo -E bash -
sudo apt-get install nodejs -y
```

1.  After installing Node.js, install pm2 on the master machine. Execute the command:


```bash
sudo npm i -g pm2
```

üë®‚Äçüíª Installing The Service
---------------------------

First, open a new terminal and navigate to the home directory with the command:

```bash
cd
```

Next, clone the repository in the home directory of the master machine with the command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/0xbaggi/display_images_service.git
```
Once cloned, navigate to the cloned folder and execute the installation script with the following commands:
```bash
cd display_images_service
bash install.sh {sudo-password}
```
> _The {sudo-password} is the master sudo password._

After installation, reboot the machine.
